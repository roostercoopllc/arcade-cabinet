# Open Source - Classic Arcade Cabinet
This is the code source for an arcade cabinet for classic videogames

## Full Walk Through
This project is also shown with it's progress at [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/184559-open-source-classic-arcade-cabinet). 

## Materials
Hardware:
1. An old laptop. But could easily be replaced with a [raspberry pi](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Pi-Extreme-Kit/dp/B08B6F8QRV/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=raspberry+pi&qid=1648247603&sr=8-3)
2. [4 joy stick and button sets](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071WC7TGK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) from amazon. You can obviously modify this for a cheaper or more expensive version, but you will also have to be aware of the firmware change.
3. 

Software:
1. If you need to make modifications, some kind of IDE. I used [visual studios code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). There are alot of plugins to help you if you are unfamiliar with some of the coding languages.
